		<h2>Day 1:MADIVARU  </h2>
		<h3>A horseshoe-shaped reef lies between 15 and 22 meters next to the island<br> 
		of Madivaru offering spectacular topography and a little bit of almost every type of marine <br>
		life found in the Maldives! Grey reef sharks, dogtooth tunas, schools of eagle rays, mobula<br>
		 rays, huge schools of trevally and jacks, stingrays, schooling barracuda, napoleons, whitetip <br>
		reef sharks, mantas and turtles. Dolphins are often seen feeding on garden eels right out of the <br>
		sand. Guitar sharks, Scalloped hammerheads, and Silvertips all make this a must do when<br>
		 diving in the Maldives.</h3>

		<h2>Day 2:MANTA BLOCK</h2>
		<h3> The Manta Block has guaranteed cleaning stations the past few years between <br>
		November and April, or what's known as "manta season". At just 13 meters, gorgeous lighting and <br>
		close encounters with large rays have made this a favorite scuba diving spot for all levels.</h3>

		<h2>Day 3: CAVES</h2>
		<h3> Large overhangs and fun swim throughs open up to sting rays, white tips and nurse sharks<br>
		. Only advanced divers are able to reach the depth required at Caves, but open water divers enjoy the <br>
		one cave within reach and a handful of shallower overhangs. Divers returning to the Maldives often have <br>
		this dive on their favorite list.</h3>

		<h2>Day 4: FAN REEF</h2>
		<h3>
		 Perfect Rasdhoo Atoll scuba diving for beginners, Fan Reef is an easy, sloped wall dive<br>
		 with several large bays and craggy coral overhangs that also make this dive site a favorite among <br>
		photographers. Whitetips or leopard sharks are often seen using the cracks and crevices on Fan Reef<br> 
		for a bit of protection while they snooze. Beautiful underwater landscapes are punctuated by sights <br>
		of turtles, napoleons, eagle rays, tuna and sting rays.<br>
