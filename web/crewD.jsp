		Imagine a career that takes you in the clouds, under the sea, on the cliffs, on a fast flowing river or even protecting untamed wilderness… And then to top it, get paid for this life in the fast-growing eco-tourism industry!!! Destination Seekers invite young girls and boys like you – seeking more out of your lives. You could take this career path, or pursue this as a passion parallel to your career. However, this isn’t the best place if you’re hunting for a mere conventional desk job…<br>

The training program is a dynamic process that covers all topics essential to be an instructor in the great outdoors. This is all about gaining knowledge in diverse fields of wildlife, adventure and traveling. We provide you with a platform and training to polish your social and communication skills, boost your confidence levels and invoke the leader in you.<br>

The course will begin in July 2019 and will continue till January 2020. The sessions, conducted on weekends will either be classroom or outdoor sessions at our various campsites in Maharashtra.<br>

The training program covers a wide range of subjects, from first aid to the environment and team building to star gazing. It is hands-on practical training under the guidance of experts in various fields. Successful candidates not only receive Destination Seekers certification but also get a Bronze level award from IAYP – Duke of Edinburgh.<br>

The first aid session scheduled in the programme is another certificate course you will undertake. Pass in the test of this course and you will proudly hold an international certificate as a first aider. Not only is this basic medical knowledge absolutely vital as a Destination Seekers instructor, it will also prove to be beneficial in your personal life.<br>

Don’t let the glamour of this deceive you though- it is a tough life for volunteers. They are required to work hard and put in substantial hours in addition to normal obligations of their colleges. But we’ll make sure that the rewards pay off all that you’ve put in. The joy of traveling to new locations, meeting new people and shouldering all your responsibilities with excellence is unparalleled.<br>

What is it that sets these youngsters at Destination Seekers apart from rest of the crowd?<br>

We, at Destination Seekers, believe that our volunteer training program makes all the difference. Sure enough, talent resides in everyone, but it is dormant. Destination Seekers provide the first opportunity for the natural talent to surface and bloom. Destination Seekers discover in you the natural leaders, naturalists, team builders, adventurers. It is great to discover yourself – give it a try. It could change your life.  <br>
